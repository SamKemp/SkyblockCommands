# SkyblockCommands
My new plugin designed for MultiCubeUK's Infinity Evolved Skyblock server.

# Requirements:
- A Minecraft Server some kind of Skyblock
- The GPPSkyBlock plugin (Found here: https://github.com/KaiKikuchi/GriefPreventionPlus-SkyBlock)
- A kit plugin that uses /kit as the command
- A kit named "newisland" with started items for players when they create a new island

# Commands:
- /skyblock {start/restart}
- /sb {start/restart}
 
# Arguments:
- start
  When the player runs "/sb start" or "/skyblock start" the plugin will create the player a new island based on the GPP SKyblock plugin's config. This command also gives the player the items defined in the "newisland" kit
- reset
  When the player runs "/sb reset" or "/skyblock reset" the plugin will create the player a new island and remove their old one based on the GPP Skyblock plugin's config. This command also gives the player the items defined in the "newisland" kit
